This program creates tiles and places then within a grid. When a tile is clicked a smiling face will replace the tile shape. If the randomizer button is clicked it will replace all tiles with new ones. The tiles are all put into an array that then paints them into the grid. The smiling face is created within the program SmileyFace.java that uses ShapesLibrary.java to get ovals to paint the face. When a tile is clicked the SmileyFace program gets called to paint a face within the tile that was clicked.
